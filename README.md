# Instagram Copy Website Using Html and Css

This repository contains a copy of the Instagram website created using HTML and CSS. The website includes the main landing page as well as a profile page.

## Getting Started

To view the website, simply clone or download the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Features

- The website includes the Instagram logo, search bar, and navigation links.
- The landing page includes a grid of posts with images, captions, and like/comment buttons.
- The profile page includes the user's profile picture, bio, and grid of posts.
- The website is responsive and will adjust to fit different screen sizes.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add additional features to the website such as:

- The ability to login and view other user's profiles.
- The ability to like, comment, and share posts.
- The ability to edit and update user's profile information.
